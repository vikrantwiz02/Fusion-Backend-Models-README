### 1. Building Model

**CORE LOGIC:**
```
Building Lifecycle Management Algorithm:
1. Initialize building record with basic details (name, dateIssued)
2. Track construction phases:
   - Construction Start → Update dateConstructionStarted
   - Construction Complete → Update dateConstructionCompleted  
   - Operational → Update dateOperational
3. Monitor status continuously:
   - Compare actual vs planned dates
   - Auto-calculate delays
   - Update status (ON_SCHEDULE/DELAYED)
4. Cost Analysis:
   - Track estimated vs actual costs
   - Calculate cost overruns
   - Generate financial reports
5. Verification Process:
   - Quality checks
   - Compliance validation
   - Set verified flag
```

**HOW IT WORKS:**
- **Status Management**: Automated tracking system compares planned vs actual timelines to determine if building is on schedule or delayed
- **Cost Tracking**: Dual cost system tracks both estimated budget and actual expenditure for financial analysis
- **Verification System**: Boolean flag system ensures quality control and compliance before marking building as operational
- **Relationship Management**: Links to Work model through foreign key for tracking all associated construction/maintenance activities

**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**
- **Asset Management**: Comprehensive tracking of institutional buildings from conception to operation
- **Budget Control**: Real-time monitoring of construction costs vs budgets to prevent overruns
- **Timeline Management**: Early warning system for delayed projects enabling proactive management
